# Code-Refactor
A marketing agency, Horiseon Social Solution Services, wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards 
and ensures their webpage is optimized for search engines. Their acceptance criteria included the following:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN they view the source code
THEN they find semantic HTML elements
WHEN they view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN they find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN they view the image elements
THEN they find accessible alt attributes
WHEN they view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN they view the title element
THEN they find a concise, descriptive title

Based on an initial review of the existing code, <div> elements were used to separate most sections, 

The page is split into five sections - the header, hero image, service descriptions, benefits, and footer.
